    ## MILITARY REGULATIONS
    # Buying military wares Open Market is illegal for common folk. Selling to approved vendors is allowed. Items are not removed. Just because you cant buy a tank does not mean that none are sold.
    # - Legal list is applied to make item or ship always legal (or illegal, if !negated),
    # - All civ-grade or civ-hint ships are always legal.,
